## Introduction
The first evaluation project is uploaded in this repository.<br/>
In my case it consists of an application to manage the attendance of the employees of the Philharmonic Orchestra of Gran Canaria.<br/>
Because the virus of this year has changed the way the people work and that ocassionate new problems in the company or in the working envioremnet,<br/>
and there must be an application or a technologie to minimize these news problems and make the life easier for the user.<br/>
For example my app is made to manage the employees petitions about where they want to work if they prefer to go to the office, or work from their houses,
or they really can´t go to office because they're ill or doing quarantine.<br/>
