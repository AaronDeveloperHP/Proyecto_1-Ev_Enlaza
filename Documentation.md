|   |Description|Advantages| Disadvantages |
|----|---------|------------------ | ------------------|
|WEB|An application designed for browsers (Example:ieselrincon.org)|-They use very little device resources where it is used<br/>-They can be adapted for any device or browser | -Slower than others<br/> -Not accessible throug appstores | 
|NATIVE|An applications that is installed in the device (Example:WhatsApp)|-They work offline<br/>-They are the fastest if they make a efficient use of the resources of the device |-They depends of your device specifications<br/>-If you want to make the app for multiple platforms, you must programm it once for each platform |
|HYBRID|An application that combines the web and native features(Example:Gmail)|-They can be installed and also used in the browser<br/>-You only have to programm once to make it multi platform|-They have a limited user interface options<br/>-Slower transitions between pages |
|PWA|A Web aplication that can be aded to the home screen of a device like a native app (example:Trivago,Pinterest)|-They have offline capabilities<br/>-They use Push Notifications<br/>-No installation or manual updates required |-Compatibility with IOS<br/>-They can´t use all the device capabilities because they aren´t native |
